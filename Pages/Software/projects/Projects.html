          <h1 class="fullSoftwareName">Extremely Minimalistic Text Editor</h1><br/>
  
          <p class="softwareDescription">In short, the name is Simpletext, and it was a project made when I was learning Nodejs. See, there's a module called Electron, which allows me to code html and css and display it as a desktop app. Electron is cross platform, and has easy tools to package and distribute the app. Simpletext allows for quick and easy text manipulation, though it's buggy and unfinished.</p>

          <h1 class="fullSoftwareName">Blooket Pin Finder</h1><br/>
  
          <p class="softwareDescription">Pretty much exactly what it sounds like. I was bored so I decided to mess around with the blooket api using the Python requests module. I managed to decode the json status of random blooket pins to determine if any of the pins were actually an online session.</p>

          <h1 class="fullSoftwareName">SDL2 C++ game</h1><br/>
  
          <p class="softwareDescription">Honestly just want to learn some c++, so I found a pretty cool library called SDL2, it's cross platform and it's what Pygame is based off of. So I thought it would be the way to go. Probably gonna rewrite the code though, since right now it's very messy. I've also had some trouble, a lot of google had to be put into this, not becuse of the SDL2, but just because of C++ in general.</p>
